# Selenium Python Project

This project uses Selenium with Python to automate web browser interactions. It is designed to perform automated testing or web scraping tasks efficiently.

## Features
- Automates browser interactions using Selenium WebDriver.
- Supports multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Modular and reusable code structure.
- Easy-to-configure environment.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Google Chrome or another supported browser
- ChromeDriver or the corresponding WebDriver for your browser

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SeleniumPython.git
   cd SeleniumPython
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and ensure it is in your system's PATH.

## Usage
1. Update the configuration file (if applicable) with the required settings, such as URLs or credentials.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python daily_job_search.py
   ```

3. Follow the output in the terminal for progress and results.
